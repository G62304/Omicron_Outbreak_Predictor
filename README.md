# Omicron_Outbreak_Predictor

Using web scraping and data frames, this project successfully predicted COVID-19 (Omicron variant) outbreaks of varying degrees in the United Kingdom, Singapore, The United States, and more. 

In its full state, the project took factors such as population density, healthcare, GDP, etc. to rank and predict the most likely location for outbreak.

The code included in this repository is only a segment of the actual project.
